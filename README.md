app.js is from the client(REACT)
server.js is from the server(EXPRESS)
have to install node.js and express.js from the internet.



3 different files to run, so there has to be 3 different instances of the terminal.

put this in a terminal: ```cd node-postgres```
1.Node postgres server/psql "node index.js" opens on port 3001

put this in another : ```cd server```
2.Middleware, python fies "node server.js" port 5000

finally : ```cd client```
3.Front end "npm start" port 3000. this should then create a localhost:3000 tab on your default web browser.
